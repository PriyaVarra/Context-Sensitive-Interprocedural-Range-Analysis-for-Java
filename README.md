# Context-Sensitive-Interprocedural-Range-Analysis-for-Java

CMU Program Analysis (17-355) Final Project Spring 2020

This repository contains a report describing the design and implementation choices for context-senstivite interprocedural range analysis on an intermediate representation of Java bytecode provided by the Soot framework (http://sable.github.io/soot/) called Jimple for the purpose of array bounds checking. 

Because this project reuses code from a previous assignment in the 17-355 course, the source code for this project is kept in a private repository. If you are interested in viewing the source code, please contact me at priyavarra13@gmail.com.
